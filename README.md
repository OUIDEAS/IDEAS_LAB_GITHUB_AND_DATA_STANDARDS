# IDEAS_LAB_GITHUB_AND_DATA_STANDARDS - Endorsed by Dr. Wilhelm
Data Storage and Github Standards for the IDEAS Lab
GitHub Standards
1.	All projects being worked on with associated code MUST have a repository in the OUIDEAS group (github.com/OUIDEAS). All repositories must be aptly named for the project it is. For example, “[INSERT NAME] Code” is NOT acceptable
2.	All repositories must have README files that explain the purpose and function of the code, as well as explain all relevant directories within the repo. EXPLAIN HOW TO USE YOUR CODE
3.	If there are setup steps needed to run the code, explain them in the README.
4.	All branches must be explained in the README
a.	If the working branch is not main then in the README write “Working branch is x” 
5.	Outline all files of interest in the README
a.	If there are files that can be ran and have a purpose outside of what was described in the purpose statement, explain them. For example, if there is a script that can make a movie of collected data point it out
6.	The corresponding data folder in the ‘IDEASDrive’ should also be included in the README so that people know where to find your data
7.	Code outputs and expected data should be outlined in the README as well
a.	No binary data should be pushed to GitHub. Utilize the gitignore
8.	If you are NOT part of the OUIDEAS group, contact Dr. Wilhelm for access. Requests must be sent over teams or in person
a.	Teams Message Outline: “Hi Dr. Wilhelm, I need access to the OUIDEAS group so I can upload my code for [INSERT PROJECT NAME]. Here is my GitHub username: [INSERT GITHUB USERNAME]. Thanks”
b.	If an in-person request was put in: “Here’s my GitHub username per our conversation earlier. [INSERT GITHUB USERNAME]. Thanks”
9.	Code should be pushed when significant progress has been made.
10.	Push notes do NOT have to be long, but should be explain any major changes
a.	Push notes can be included in weekly reports in addition to GitHub

Data Storage Standards
1.	Data should be uploaded to the ‘IDEASDrive’ or ‘WilhelmVault’ network drive (the Synology)
2.	Data includes relevant plots, csv’s, databases, txt files, anything you would include in a report/paper/use to quantify your progress
3.	Data folders should be aptly named
a.	‘MichaelData1’ is NOT an acceptable folder name for data
4.	Data file titles can be messy if there is a text file explaining what’s what
5.	If data cannot be stored in the ‘IDEASDrive’ or ‘WilhelmVault’ network drive, there MUST be something in either the network drive or GitHub repository explaining how to access data
6.	To get to the ‘IDEASDrive’ network drive
a.	Open browser
b.	Go to 192.168.1.108 for 1 Gigabit 
c.	Go to 192.168.1.109 for 10 Gigbit
7.	To get to the ‘WilhelmVault’ network drive
a.	Open browser
b.	Go to 192.168.1.214 
8.	If you do NOT have credentials to access the network drive, contact Dr. Wilhelm for access. Requests must be sent over teams or in person
a.	Teams Message Outline: “Hi Dr. Wilhelm, I need access to the lab network drive to upload my data. Thanks”
9.	If code is a WIP then whenever you push to the GitHub, upload any relevant data to the drive and name the folder accordingly
a.	For example, if a simulation is not giving desired results then at the end of the week upload data to a folder titled something like
i.	“[INSERT PROJECT TITLE] Data [INSERT DATA]”
